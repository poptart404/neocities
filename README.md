# poptart.dev neocities site

My contribution to the growing indie web. Many thanks to [onio.neocities.org](https://onio.neocities.org)'s [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkUgOT22F5s) which introduced me to this community!

As I build this site I'll try to include all of the resources I use and learn from below:

* [rusty-bytes](https://rusty-bytes.neocities.org/) ([github](https://github.com/rusty-bytes7)) has some really nice, clean code which I've found easy to follow. Their site was where I got the idea for my baja blast counter which is one of my favorite features.
* I used ollama and llm models to get a starting point for the "sparkles" button, though to be honest I ended up re-writing nearly all of it anyway because it was pretty meh. I'm quite pleased with it now though.
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_three_columns.asp) for information on how to create a 3-column layout
