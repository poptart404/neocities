            <h1>Building A Cyberdeck</h1><br><br>
            <h2>Background</h2><br>
            <p>I'm mainly fascinated with cyberdecks as someone who grew up in the age of cell phones with physical qwerty keyboards. I had one of those little LG phones that when rotated to a landscape orientation would slide out a small keyboard for typing messages to friends. If I remember correctly the iPhone had already been released by this time but was still prohibitively expensive for most, especially for high school or college students.</p><br>
            <p>The keyboard itself had its issues, it was very short with the top row of keys right up against the edge of the top part of the case, making those keys sometimes tough to press accurately. But it was miles better than the touchscreen keybaord I had a few years later on my first smartphone, an iPhone 4S.</p><br>
            <h2>Goals</h2><br>
            <p>My goal is mainly focused around a small device for messaging, accessing my media server and things like jellyfin, immich, and a terminal. Really that ends up being a lot of the functions I use a smartphone for, but like a lot of folks I've become frustrated with the constant tracking and ads and lack of privacy that is the norm these days. In the long term I could see something like this being a companion to a heavily reduced smartphone, where the phone meets the basic need of keeping my phone number and taking calls, using required applications for work, and answering sms-type text messages. The cyber deck would be able to meet the other "smartphone" needs and hopefully become my primary device.</p><br>
            <p>A split of functions between these devices could look like this:<br><br>
                Smartphone: phone, sms, work apps, gps navigation, and day-to-day life apps like when you have to download an app to pay for parking (which is awful but it is reality at times), and similar functions. <br>
                Cyberdeck: messaging, email, calendar, utilities, web browsing, media (online video sites, personal media server), access to photo library, and small games (gotta have Doom of course).
            </p><br>
            <p>I also make use of a modded 2nd gen iPod mini which has a new battery and flash storage mod which has been a wonderful asset. I use a Kobo eReader for reading ebooks, in addition to a collection of paper books. For photos, I do find the camera on my smartphone to be a very useful utility, but I also try to use my 35mm film camera for capturing photos with family and friends that I will want to look back on. So far I've found these to be helpful ways of de-centralizing my smartphone in my life and I feel like I have gained back time and have a less cluttered brain as a result.</p><br>
